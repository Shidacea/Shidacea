# Shidacea

Shidacea is the main library of the eponymous Shidacea game framework.

It is used on top of a core implementation, of which currently two exist:

* The main implementation written in Crystal: https://github.com/Shidacea/Shipectral
* The legacy implementation written in C++: https://github.com/Shidacea/Shidacea-CPP

The current version of this implementation is 0.2.1.

In the future, only the Shipectral core will be used and Shidacea-CPP will become deprecated.
However, old branches of this library and the launcher Launshi will still be available.

In the future, a 0.3.0 version will be released, which will not be compatible to 0.2.1 anymore.
